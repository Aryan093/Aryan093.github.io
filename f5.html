        Green algae are a diverse group of photosynthetic microorganisms that thrive in various aquatic environments, including freshwater and marine ecosystems. Like their terrestrial counterparts, they contain chlorophyll and other pigments, allowing them to harness sunlight for photosynthesis. Green algae play essential roles in aquatic food webs, serving as a primary food source for many aquatic organisms. They are often found in coastal regions, rivers, lakes, and ponds. While some green algae species exist as single cells or colonies, others form more complex structures, such as filaments or sheets. Their ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions makes them ecologically significant contributors to aquatic ecosystems.
