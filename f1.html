        Diatoms are a group of microscopic phytoplankton known for their intricate, glass-like cell walls made of silica. These single-celled algae are found in various aquatic environments, from oceans to freshwater bodies. Diatoms are ecologically significant as they are among the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth. Their unique cell structures come in diverse shapes and sizes, making them key players in aquatic food webs. Additionally, diatoms play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and contributing to the sequestration of carbon in ocean sediments. Their presence and abundance serve as important indicators of water quality and environmental health.
