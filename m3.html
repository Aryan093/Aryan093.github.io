            1. Primary Producers: At the base of the marine food web are primary producers, such as phytoplankton
            (including diatoms and cyanobacteria) and marine algae. These microscopic or plant-like organisms use
            photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy, making them the primary source of organic matter in the
            ocean. <br>

            2. Primary Consumers: Herbivores or primary consumers feed on primary producers. These can include
            zooplankton, small fish, and invertebrates like krill, which graze on phytoplankton and algae. <br>

            3. Secondary Consumers: Secondary consumers are carnivores that prey on primary consumers. They can include
            larger fish, squids, and some marine mammals. These organisms obtain their energy by consuming herbivores or
            other secondary consumers. <br>

            4. Tertiary Consumers: In some cases, there are tertiary consumers, which are top predators in the marine
            food web. Examples include apex predators like sharks, killer whales, and large carnivorous fish. They feed
            on secondary consumers or other tertiary consumers. <br>

            5. Decomposers: such as bacteria and fungi, play a crucial role in breaking down dead organisms and organic
            matter in the marine ecosystem. They help recycle nutrients, making them available for primary producers to
            use again. <br>

            Human activities, including overfishing and pollution, can disrupt marine food webs. Overfishing can deplete
            populations of key species, leading to imbalances in the ecosystem. Pollution, such as oil spills and
            nutrient runoff, can harm both primary producers and consumers, impacting the entire food web. <br>

            A balanced marine food web is crucial for the health and stability of ocean ecosystems. Disruptions in the
            food web can have cascading effects, affecting the abundance and distribution of species throughout the
            ecosystem which eventually leads to imbalance in Carbon-dioxide and Oxygen levels. <br>
