            1. Natural Carbon Sequestration: Natural processes and ecosystems sequester carbon in various ways. Forests,
            for example, act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO2 during photosynthesis and storing it in tree biomass and
            soil. Ocean ecosystems, including phytoplankton and coral reefs, also sequester carbon by incorporating it
            into their structures and through the biological pump. <br>

            2. Artificial Carbon Sequestration: Human activities have led to an increase in CO2 levels in the
            atmosphere, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. To counteract this, artificial
            carbon sequestration methods have been developed. These include techniques like carbon capture and storage
            (CCS), where CO2 emissions from industrial processes are captured and stored underground to prevent their
            release into the atmosphere. <br>

            3. Soil Sequestration: Agricultural practices such as afforestation (planting trees), reforestation
            (replanting forests), and implementing conservation tillage techniques can enhance carbon sequestration in
            soil. Healthy soils can store significant amounts of carbon in the form of organic matter. <br>

            4. Geological Sequestration: Geological storage of CO2 involves injecting captured carbon dioxide deep
            underground into geological formations, like depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. This method
            prevents CO2 from re-entering the atmosphere. <br>

            5. Enhanced Weathering : Enhanced weathering is a natural process that can be accelerated. It involves the
            breakdown of rocks that absorb CO2 during the process. This can occur naturally or through human-assisted
            methods, such as spreading crushed rocks on agricultural fields. <br>

            6. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS): BECCS is a technology that combines the use of
            bioenergy sources like biomass with carbon capture and storage. It aims to generate energy while capturing
            and storing more carbon than is released during the energy generation proces
            Thus, Carbon sequestration is a critical tool in the fight against climate change, helping to reduce CO2
            levels in the atmosphere and minimize its impact on the Earth's climate. <br>
