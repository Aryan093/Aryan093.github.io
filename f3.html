            Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria found in various aquatic environments. They are unique among bacteria because they can carry out photosynthesis, using pigments like chlorophyll to convert sunlight into energy. Cyanobacteria play a crucial role in the Earth's ecosystems; they are significant contributors to primary production, providing a source of energy and oxygen in aquatic systems. However, under certain conditions, some cyanobacteria can form harmful algal blooms (HABs) that produce toxins harmful to aquatic life and humans. Despite this, cyanobacteria are essential components of nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems and have even been studied for their potential applications in fields like biotechnology and wastewater treatment.</p>
